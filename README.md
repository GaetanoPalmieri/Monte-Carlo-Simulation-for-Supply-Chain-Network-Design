# Monte-Carlo-Simulation-in-Python

Build a simple methodology of Supply Chain Network Design that is considering the fluctuation of the demand from market.

Supply chain optimization makes the best use of data analytics to find an optimal combination of factories and distribution centres to meet the demand of your customers. In many software and solutions in the market, the core structure behind is a Linear Programming Model. Some of these models find the right allocation of factories to meet the demand and minimize the costs assuming a constant demand.

What happens if the demand is fluctuating?
Your network may lose robustness, especially if you have a very high seasonality of your demand (e-commerce, cosmetics, fast fashion).

Objective: minimize the total cost of production and shipment

The objective is to design a new transportation plan to increase the average size of trucks by delivering more stores per route.
